First thing you have to do is enable viewing file extensions in your folder options so you can modify them.
Google "How to modify file extensions" if you don't know how to do that.
You will also require a proper text editing program such as Notepad++ or Sublime Text (Both are free)
Keep in mind opening .config, .patch, and other such files is required, so you need one such program.

To make sure your additions load into the game, you must add a .metadata file to the root folder of your mod.
Thats the full name, ".metadata", nothing before the dot.
If your OS doesn't allow you to create a nameless file, simply copy and paste that file from my mod, and replace the data within with this:

{
  "author" : "yournamehere",
  "description" : "yourdescriptionhere",
  "friendlyName" : "Mod name here",
  "includes" : ["ztarbound", "FrackinUniverse"],
  "name" : "modnamehere",
  "version" : "1"
}

You can freely modify any of the fields, except for includes. Those must stay there.

If you don't know much about Starbound modding, it is advised you read through this first:

But keep this in mind:
Do NOT directly modify any files in ZB unless you know what you're doing.
That means already present configs, patches, and lua scripts.
Creating patches is not considered as direct modification.
You CAN modify already present images, but its better off to add that as a separate addon from your other content.
